# Generic (TD-)CC solver based on sparse algebra

## Current capabilities
- [x] Arbitrary order TCC, UCC, dUCC (traditional, unitary, disentangled unitary)
- [x] Arbitrary n-hole m-particle EOM-(T/U/dU)CC (full diagonlization or Davidson)
- [x] Arbitrary order CI (full diagonlization or Davidson)
- [x] TD-EOM(T/U/dU)CC in determinant basis (i.e., Davidson-based) for a generic user-defined time dependent Hamiltonian
- [x] TD-dUCC with time-dependent, complex amplitudes
- [x] TDCI 
## Todo
- [ ] Refactor to enable adaptive thresholding
- [ ] TD-TCC
- [ ] More tests for TD-EOMCC
